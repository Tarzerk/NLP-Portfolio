The best Elden Ring (opens in new tab) weapons can be the difference between struggling through The Lands Between inch by inch, or carving a brisk and bloody path towards your rightful Elden Lordhood. And while yes, there's clout in taking on every boss with a wooden club, there are so many weird and wonderful tools for murder hidden across the world that are well worth hunting down.
A solid sword and shield will do you well, but Elden Ring's most interesting weapons sport unique Ashes (read: abilities) that form the cornerstone of a devastating moveset. Swords that turn you into a cloud of fury, whips that harden into lances, bows that unleash thunderous torrents of magic-infused arrows. Some Elden Ring bosses (opens in new tab) drop "remembrances" which can then be turned into boss weapons, offering arguably stronger skills. 
Whether you're starting from scratch or looking for a new tool to spice up your arsenal, here's what we reckon are the best Elden Ring weapons.
The best Elden Ring weapons across the game's entire arsenal are the kind of items you suit your build for, not the other way around. These weapons are must-haves if you want to become the hot knife for all your buttery enemies.
