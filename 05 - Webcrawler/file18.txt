If you've picked up an Elden Ring Great Rune in the Lands Between, you might want to know what to do with it. The main bosses (opens in new tab) drop them, alongside Remembrances (opens in new tab), and they can offer a handy boost to your Tarnished—provided you take the steps needed to activate them.
You can equip a Great Rune at a Site of Grace once it's been activated, but you'll need to use a Rune Arc for it to give you its passive bonus effects. You can only equip one at a time, too, so you should take note of what each one does and switch between them for different encounters or areas. 
A word of warning: Boss names appear in this guide, so click away now if you'd rather avoid potential spoilers. Otherwise, here's what you need to know about Elden Ring Great Runes, including where to find the Rune Arc items needed to get their effects. 
Whenever you pick up a Great Rune from a boss, you'll need to restore it before it can be equipped. To do this, head to the Divine Tower in the region of the boss that dropped the rune. As an example, Godrick is the first boss that drops a Great Rune, so you need to make your way to the Divine Tower of Limgrave.
The good news is that once a Great Rune has been restored, you won't have to do it again. If you're planning on switching them often, however, you should make sure you have plenty of Rune Arcs.
Restoring a Great Rune isn't enough to actually see its benefit. To make use of the passive effects a rune offers, you'll need to equip it, then activate it using a Rune Arc. 
Rune Arcs are fairly rare drops from enemies—mostly from rats, though still not often—and they can occasionally be found in chests or on corpses. The most reliable way to get your hands on the item is from the vendors at Roundtable Hold and Liurnia of the Lakes. Each Rune Arc item will set you back 4,000 Runes.

Here are the Great Runes we've found so far, along with the effects they offer and where to restore them:
Godrick's Great Rune
Great Rune of the Unborn
Radahn's Great Rune
Morgott's Great Rune
Rykard's Great Rune
Mogh's Great Rune 
Malenia's Great Rune

In 2021, she was offered a full-time position on the PC Gamer team where she takes every possible opportunity to talk about World of Warcraft and Elden Ring. When not writing guides, most of her spare time is spent in Azeroth—though she's quite partial to JRPGs too. One of her fondest hopes is to one day play through the ending of Final Fantasy X without breaking down into a sobbing heap. She probably has more wolves in Valheim than you.
